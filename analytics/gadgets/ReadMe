We use WSO2DAS and Jaggery Server to host our gadgets. 

To Deploy a gadget, place the gadget folder (eg:JenkinsBuildTable) in the following location: 
<wso2das home>/<repository>/<deployment>/<server>/<jaggery apps>/<portal>/<store>/<carbon.super>/<gadget>

Create a directory inside the <jaggery home>/<apps> location and name it 'hostedForGadgets'. 
Then Place the DataJenkinsBuildTable.jag file inside it.

Run both servers and visit the DAS dashboard at: https://localhost:9445/portal/
(Here the port is 9445 because the DAS server has been run on a port offset of 2)

Use 'admin' as the username and password to login to the dashboard.

Create a dashboard and drag and drop the gadget into the dashboard and click on 'Preview'.
Enable option to load insecure script.
This would display the gadget in the dashboard!

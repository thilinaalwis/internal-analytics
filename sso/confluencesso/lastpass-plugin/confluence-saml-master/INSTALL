To install from source, first generate the installation
package:

  ant tar

Then uncompress the resulting .tar.gz file from the out
directory, and run the install script.

Optionally, you may use the appropriate ant targets to
generate debian or rpm packages.

After installation, you will need to configure the
Service Provider and Identity Provider settings in the
confluence directory.

First rename them appropriately:

    cd $ATLASSIAN_HOME
    mv idp-metadata.xml.sample idp-metadata.xml
    mv sp-metadata.xml.sample sp-metadata.xml

And then edit the xml files to reflect your entity ID
and URLs.

If you are using the LastPass IdP service, you may
download the idp-metadata.xml file for your organization
here:

    https://lastpass.com/enterprise_saml.php?metadata

You will also need to configure the IdP with the service
provider entity ID and the URLs.

Once satisfied with the configuration, restart Confluence.

You'll need to visit https://yoursite/saml_login.jsp to
log in with SAML.
